#### Introduction
Students, Teachers, and Parents need to be in communication about grades. Using JavaScript, it is possible to create a portal for up-to-date assignment reports. By creating this as a web application, these three groups can have a better time engaging in the learning process.

Teachers should be able to monitor their various classes and assignments. Students should be able to see their grades as well as upcoming/ungraded assignments. Parents should be able to see their studentsâ€™ grades and assignments.

To solve this, we have created an MVC style JavaScript application, using MongoDB, Express, Node.js, Mustache and Bootstrap.
