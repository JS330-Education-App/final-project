### Introduction
Students, Teachers, and Parents need to be in communication about grades. Using JavaScript, it is possible to create a portal for up-to-date assignment reports. By creating this as a web application, these three groups can have a better time engaging in the learning process.

Teachers should be able to monitor their various classes and assignments. Students should be able to see their grades as well as upcoming/ungraded assignments. Parents should be able to see their studentsâ€™ grades and assignments.

To solve this, we have created an MVC style JavaScript application, using MongoDB, Express, Node.js, Mustache and Bootstrap. 

To test this...
1. Register a teacher
2. Register a student, using their teacher's email
3. Register a parent, using their student's email

Once logged in, you will be directed to either the teacher view, student view or parent view. 

Teachers will be able to...
--create assignments and assign them to their students
--view their students and all of their assignments
--grade assignments
--delete assignments
--search assignments via title or content

Students will be able to...
--view all of their assignments
--view their overall grade
--view the grades for all of their assignments
--submit assignments and check assignment status

Parents will be able to...
--view their student's overall grade
--view all of their student's assignments
--view the grades for their student's assignments
