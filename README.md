# Week 3

This week is a deeper dive into advanced MongoDB features. We will practice using these advanced features within a REST API.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this week, a student should:
- be comfortable using MongoDB for more than simple CRUD operations
- be able to use indexes for performance and uniqueness
- have implemented text search, aggregation, indexes, and lookups 

## The assignment

The assignment this week is designed to get you to use advanced MongoDB functions to solve problems that go beyond basic CRUD. We will use MongoDB as the data source for two sets of CRUD routes within an Express server. We'll then implement more complex APIs that will require advanced Mongo features.

### Getting started

1. Make sure you have a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your computer. I am using Node v12.16, but anything above 12 will be fine.
2. Ensure you have git and github set up on your computer. If you do not, please follow this guide: https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github.
3. Fork this repository and clone it locally. 
4. In your terminal, from inside this project directory, run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
5. Download and install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community). This project uses the default MongoDB configuration. If you run Mongo in a non-standard way you may need to update the configuration in `index.js` to match. If you have issues, reference the [Mongoose Connection Guide](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html).
6. Run `npm start` to start your local server. You should see a logged statement telling you `Server is listening on http://localhost:5000`.
7. Download [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or an API client of your choice. Browse the various endpoints contained in this project. Practice calling all of them and getting 200 HTTP responses.
8. Run the unit tests of this project: `npm test`. Your test output should end in something like this:
```
Test Suites: 1 failed, 1 passed, 2 total
Tests:       8 failed, 52 passed, 60 total
```

### Your Task

We are working on an API for books and authors. There is a complete set of CRUD routes and tests already provided for these two entities, so you do not need to complete basic CRUD functions.

However, there are a number of tests that are currently failing. Your task is to write the additional route, DAO, and model code that will get these tests passing. Doing so will require the use of the advanced Mongo features we learned about in Week 3, potentially in combination.

Once all the provided tests are passing then you should know your code is correct. You should not make any changes to the test files.


### Grading

Component | Points
--------- | --------
All tests, as originally given, are passing. | 80
Clear, organized project structure | 20

### Submission

- Create a pull request (PR) from your repository to the main branch of this repository. Make your name the title of the PR. 
- Continuous Integration is handled using Github Actions. This will automatically run your tests and show the results on your PR. If you see a red X and a message saying `All checks have failed` then you will not receive full credit. Ensure all tests are passing in order to receive full marks.
